# RLWE

This repository has two software implementations of the Ring-LWE-based encryption scheme. Both implementations follow the pseudocode of Clercq et al. in [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/725.pdf) and are not optimized for any purpose. It is only for exploratory research. The first uses C language and targets an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller. Recently (October, 2017), we added a desktop implementation written in C++ using the NTL library for arithmetic in the polynomial ring.
